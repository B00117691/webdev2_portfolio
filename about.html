<div class="bio">
I began to love photography at a very young age. Upon receiving my first Canon camera several years back I fell in love with the craft. It is sometime that I have loved for many years, it was a hobby that stayed with me since the day I got my camera – unlike swimming and tennis which my interest in faded rather quickly. After continuing to capture beautiful moments in life I realized it was something I would like to do for the rest of my life. It was something I wanted to continue to learn and pursuit. I have now begun my first year in college at TU Dublin – Blanchardstown, choosing a course in Creative Digital Media (CDM).
<br><br>
I entered this course in hopes of obtaining a degree that will help me make my photography career possible, I hope to learn more about photography itself. I like to photograph mostly portraits and nature. However, close up photography is sometime I am also passionate about. I like to show the true beauty behind each photograph. I like to show a story behind each photograph, show how unique each are and how no two are alike.
